# CodeCademy Go Repo

Hello World This is my repo in which to store all of my learnings about the programming language of Go, from the course provided by Codecademy (and perhaps beyond). Created in 2009, Go was built by Google developers as a 'compiled, high-level programming language'<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))</sup> to increase productivity at the tech company. The designers sought to bring the efficiency of C and readability of Python, while maintaining high levels of performance.
